# Meta Spark Templates

The purpose of this repo is to provide updated custom templates for [Meta Spark Studio](https://spark.meta.com/) (formerly known as Spark AR Studio).

This project is work in progress so templates will be released over time.

Feel free to suggest templates you wish to see here.

## Templates

1. Native Picker TypeScript
   - The official [Picker](https://spark.meta.com/learn/reference/classes/nativeuimodule.picker) documentation provides the JavaScript version. My version includes the changes made for TypeScript.
